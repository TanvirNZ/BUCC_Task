This project is a simple digital stopwatch built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays elapsed time in the format of hours, minutes, and seconds (HH:MM:SS) and provides basic controls to start, stop, and reset the timer. The layout is structured with HTML, styled using an external CSS file, and the core functionality—incrementing time, updating the display, and handling button interactions—is implemented in JavaScript. It uses image buttons for an intuitive interface. To build and run the project, all you need to do is create an HTML file (as shown), link a CSS file for styling, and ensure the start, stop, and reset button images are placed in an images folder. Open the HTML file in a web browser to use the stopwatch. One of the challenges in building this type of project is ensuring accurate time tracking and preventing multiple intervals from stacking if the start button is clicked repeatedly. A key feature of this project is its simplicity and user-friendly design, making it a great beginner-level JavaScript exercise.
